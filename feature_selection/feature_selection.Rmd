- Use spambase dataset
- Learn a classifier with all the features. (Random Forest)
    - Estimate its goodness by 10 fold cross-validation.
- Do feature extraction (optional, PCA)
- Do feature selection.
    1. Univariate FS
        - calculate correlation between each term and the class.
        - build a classifier with the top 10 features

    2. Multivariate FS
        - Correlated FS
        - Wrapper FS
        - Search Heuristic -> Greedy stepwise (add features while improving)
